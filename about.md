title: About
---

I've developed online solutions for companies and clients using the Microsoft .NET Framework since 2003.  This has ranged from cloud based web applications, native mobile applications, custom API integrations and everything in between. Including owning the technical design, identifying trade offs and prioritizing tasks that lead to the highest business value.

I'm confident giving technical presentations having spoken at conferences such as Tech-Ed NZ, NDC Sydney, Ignite NZ and .NET Conf as well as countless user groups.

Throughout these projects I've lead teams of developers, and with code reviews, technical guidance and mentorship have built solid teams that tackled a wide variety of problems with success.

I'm currently based in Auckland, New Zealand as a Principal Software Engineer at [Pushpay][pp].
